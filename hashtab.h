/* I needed a hashtable for a project and wanted to code my own. This
 * hashtable compromises speed for reliability, specifically with
 * growing the hashtable.
 *
 * The hashtable does not grow automatically, but when the hashtable
 * grow function is called. Growing the hashtable is a safe operation:
 * if growing the hashtable fails, the existing hashtable is not
 * destroyed or modified.
 *
 * This hashtable is not thread-safe.
